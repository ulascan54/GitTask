# Git and GitHub Task

Welcome to the Git and GitHub Workshop Task!. **To receive certified**, you need to complete the following task. This task will help you understand the basics of Git and GitHub, which are essential tools for software development.

## Task Description

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this private organization repository to your local machine.

2. **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch with a name that includes your name and surname (e.g., `firstname-lastname`).

3. **Create a Blank File:** Create a blank text file with the name as your school ID number (e.g., `20210702XXX.txt`) in your branch.

4. **Commit and Push the Branch:** Commit the new file and push your branch to the repository on GitHub.

5. **Edit the File:** Open the file you just created and add your name and surname to it. Save the changes.

6. **Commit and Push:** Commit the changes you made to the file and push them to your branch.

7. **Create a Pull Request:** Finally, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes into the `submission` branch. We'll review your PR.

## Tips

- Remember <b>**_NOT TO PUSH_**</b> directly to the main branch.
- Keep your commit messages clear and concise.

Good luck, and happy coding!
